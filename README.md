# DataSci_project

<!-- DH general comments

- This empty readme doesn't do anything. Give an introduction to the project and some setup instructions, as necessary. 

- Your EDA skips most of Peng and Matsui's checklist, and doesn't give any exposition.  What are these data?  Why are we looking at them?  What do we expect to see?  Is that what we see?
